ERROR: at 540 ns(10000): Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "C:/Users/Pineda/Desktop/2017/arquitectura/procesador3/procesador3/MUXF.vhd" Line 50. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.

INFO: Simulator is stopped.
